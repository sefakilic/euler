Peter has nine four-sided (pyramidal) dice, each with faces numbered 1, 2, 3, 4.
Colin has six six-sided (cubic) dice, each with faces numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

Peter and Colin roll their dice and compare totals: the highest total wins. The
result is a draw if the totals are equal.

What is the probability that Pyramidal Pete beats Cubic Colin? Give your answer
rounded to seven decimal places in the form 0.abcdefg
